# AnroidConfig in Kotlin #

### Introduction ###

This project is written in Kotlin and is a **wrapper around ADB.exe** to communicate with an Android device connected over USB or TCP/IP.

A similar tool was written in Python, and with this project I am trying to master Kotlin.

For now, it will only offer a commandline interface. A GUI will be implemented later.

This project is inspired by https://github.com/Szaki/XiaomiADBFastbootTools
